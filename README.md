dungeonkeepstore
================

Hasbro hacking.  Created a mock of a store to cultivate dungeons and dragons as a community that allows for trade, karmic tracking and rewards.  I believe improving the resources and allowing D and D lovers to sell their own material would encourage a lot of creativity and life in the franchise and thereby improve profitability.
